This is version (1.01) of the JCMT::SCUBA perl module
-----------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION

The code in this module was originally written for the Integration
Time Calculator (ITC) - a CGI script which is currently being used
for estimating the ammount of integration time required to achieve
a desired S/N ratio with SCUBA at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.
(see http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jcmt_sw/bin/itc.pl).

The module contains perl functions relating to SCUBA, and for 
performing the SCUBA specific integration time calculations. 


INSTALLATION

This is a fairly simple, self-contained module. All that should be
required is the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	% make install
